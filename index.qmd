I'm Olivia Pietrzak, an aspiring data sciencist pursuing my master's degree in Social Data Analytics and Research at the University of Texas at Dallas. I graduated with honors from the economics department at UTD in December 2022, and I currently work as a Data Analyst at Dallas College within the Strategic Research and Analytics department. In this role, I use data to help college leadership identify and dismantle barriers to student success.

My research passions converge at the crossroads of economic justice, education, and labor economics. I am excited to contribute to meaningful projects that make a positive impact, I am committed to leveraging data insights to drive positive change in these crucial areas.
