## Lecture 4: Cognitive Science in Data Visualization

-   Importance of negative space in visualizations (it can be useful, or it can be very difficult to decode)

-   Importance of color in visualizations (again, it can help clarify or it can confuse)

-   Importance of first letter in a word for fast identification of the word (goggle image example)

-   Increased complexity in visualization = end-users spend additional attention on cognitive processing.

For image above: Remember that these processes are siloed and that progress from one area to the next does not mean that your message will be decipherable to your end user.

*Aside: Eye contact makes for a good presentation according to Dr. Ho. Eye contact = data collection.*

**Nominalist approach/symbolic approach to data visualization**

Understand the context of your audience; be mindful of your design choices (e.g., cultural sensitivity to particular colors, color-blindness, etc).

### Visualization Stages

1.       Collection and storage of data

2.       Data transformation and preprocessing

3.       Mapping data to a visualization

4.       Human perception of visualization.

### Semiotics of graphics

Semiotics = study of symbols and how they convey meaning

Worst case scenario: there is an increase in cognitive load without increase in information conveyed. Use semiotics to reduce this.

Complexity = the connection between many different things and how they interact/influence each other

Simplicity = the connection between a few things and how they interact/influence each other

**Complexity and simplicity are relative to the user – they are not static characteristics**

              Users gain more skill, technology grows

              Things don’t always grow at the same rate; keep in mind what growth you anticipate

              Their relationship depends on a lot of things (e.g., peoples' willingness to learn)

### Cognitive Science Guidelines

Important data elements should be represented by graphical elements that are visually more distinct than those representing less important information.

              Color: not good for lots of categories

              Different Shapes: better for lots of categories, may run out

              Characters/Names: best for lots of categories

Greater numerical values should be represented by more distinct graphical elements.

Graphical symbol systems should be standardized within and across applications.

Choose the most efficient tool for a task.

-   *Would you use Illustrator or Excel to generate a basic bar chart?*

Only go for novelty when the anticipated payoff is greater than the cost. Otherwise stick with the tried and true.

Effort spent needs to be proportional to the payoff/profits.

-   *Ask yourself: Is this worth the effort?*

**Perception can be learned.**

### Functionalism

User, Designer, and Scientist

-   Each role has different skill-set and role within the visualization process

Elements of the graphic

Angular data encoding is not effective – try not to use pie charts.

-   Only when you have a clear majority or plurality
